# Netflix_Cleaned_Dataset
ðŸ”¹ Data Cleaning Process:
This repository includes two datasets:

1. netflix_titles.xlsx: The original, raw dataset containing information about Netflix titles.

2. Netflix_Cleaned_Dataset.xlsx: The cleaned and preprocessed version of the original dataset.

ðŸ”¹ Tools Used:
Microsoft Excel Power Query was used to clean and transform the dataset efficiently.

ðŸ”¹ Cleaning Steps Performed:
The following steps were taken to clean the dataset and prepare it for further analysis:

1. Removed Null Values:
All rows containing NULL, NaN, or missing values were identified and removed to ensure consistency and avoid analytical errors.

2. Removed Irrelevant Columns:
Columns that did not add analytical value or were redundant were dropped from the dataset to streamline the data structure.

3. Dropped Irrelevant Rows:
Any rows with ambiguous, placeholder, or incomplete information that did not contribute meaningful insights were excluded from the dataset.

4. Standardized Text Formatting:
Textual values were standardized for consistency (e.g., capitalization, date formats, genre classifications) where applicable.

5. Verified Data Integrity:
Ensured that key fields like title, type, release_year, and country contain meaningful and accurate data.
